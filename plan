press number keys to change the currently display value.
each subsequent number press should concatenate.


when an operater key is pressed, some actions are to happen:
    1. the currently displayed value  -> an array of stored values
    2. the selected operator is stored in a variable
    3. new number presses will not concatenate the current display value,
       instead, they will create a new display value (and concatenate on this new string).

    IF the stored array.length == 2 then run the code that the equals button calls


when the equals sign is pressed:
    1. check if there are 2 values in the stored values array
        if there is 
            {pass the currently selected operator and splice the stored values array to the operate function}
        else
            {return}
    2. the returned value from the operate function should be pushed into the stored value array
    3. the value of the stored value array[0] should be displayed
    4. new number presses should not concat the currently displayed value. they should create a new display value


the operate function will take the current operator (ie '+') and the stored values array as arguments

depending on the operator, the function will send the array to the approripate operation function (ie the add function)
